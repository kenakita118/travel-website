            <div class="details_text">
                <p>The Eiffel Tower, one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, has a storied history dating back to its construction in the late 19th century. Completed in 1889, the tower was designed by Gustave Eiffel as the entrance arch for the 1889 World's Fair, also known as the Exposition Universelle, held in Paris to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution.

                The construction of the Eiffel Tower was a monumental engineering feat, utilizing over 18,000 individual iron pieces and held together by more than two million rivets. Despite initial criticism for its design, the tower soon became a symbol of Paris and a marvel of modern engineering.
                
                Originally intended to stand for only 20 years, the Eiffel Tower was nearly dismantled in 1909. However, it was saved due to its valuable role in telecommunications, serving as a radio transmission tower. Over the years, the Eiffel Tower has become a global cultural icon, attracting millions of visitors annually who come to admire its architectural brilliance, panoramic views of Paris, and its significance in French history and culture. Today, it stands as a testament to both artistic and engineering achievement.</p>
