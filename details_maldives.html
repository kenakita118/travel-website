            <div class="details_text">
                <p>The Maldives, an Indian Ocean archipelago, has a history spanning over 2,000 years. Initially settled by Dravidian people, it embraced Buddhism around the 3rd century BC. In the 12th century, Islam was introduced, shaping the Maldives into a predominantly Muslim nation. The islands experienced Portuguese and Dutch influence in the 16th and 17th centuries before becoming a British protectorate in the 19th century. Full independence was achieved in 1965.
    
                Upon gaining independence, the Maldives transitioned to a republic in 1968, with President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom leading for three decades until 2008. The subsequent years witnessed political changes, including the country's first multiparty presidential election in 2008, resulting in Mohamed Nasheed's presidency. However, his term faced challenges, and he resigned in 2012. The Maldives continued to grapple with political shifts and leadership changes in the following years. Notably, the nation actively advocated for global action against climate change, given its vulnerability to rising sea levels. Today, the Maldives is renowned for its picturesque landscapes and is a sought-after tourist destination.</p>
