            <div class="details_text">
                <p>Rome, the capital city of Italy, boasts a rich history that spans over 2,800 years. Legend has it that Rome was founded by Romulus and Remus in 753 BC. Initially a monarchy, it evolved into a republic around 509 BC, characterized by a system of checks and balances.

                The Roman Republic saw expansion across the Mediterranean, marked by the Punic Wars against Carthage. In 45 BC, Julius Caesar's crossing of the Rubicon River led to the demise of the republic, and Rome transitioned into an empire. Augustus, the first emperor, ushered in the Pax Romana, a period of relative peace and prosperity.
                
                The Roman Empire reached its zenith under Trajan in the 2nd century AD, encompassing vast territories. However, economic challenges, invasions, and internal strife contributed to its decline. In 476 AD, the Western Roman Empire fell to the Germanic chieftain Odoacer.
                
                Rome's legacy endures through its contributions to law, governance, architecture, and culture. The Roman Catholic Church, established in Rome, became a dominant force. The city experienced Renaissance revival in the 15th century, with artists like Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci leaving an indelible mark. Today, Rome stands as a captivating blend of ancient ruins and modern vibrancy, reflecting its enduring significance in world history.</p>
